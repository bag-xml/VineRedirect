# VineRedirect
 Simple iOS tweak for redirecting Vine API traffic

# How does it work?
VineRedirect works by filtering all outgoing requests of the app and only changing the URLs that are related to the Vine API to a URL set in the settings page. After installing VineRedirect, please go into the settings app and immediately set a link, because if you don't have one, the app crashes.
# How to build?
You need theos in order to build the tweak. Additionally to that, this tweak was built with the iOS 7.0 SDK, get that from [here](https://invoxiplaygames.uk/sdks). Simply use the "make package" command
